<p class="heading">Omega Virus</p>
<p class="white">Omega Virus was a 1992 board game for 1 to 4 players that required an electronic computer component in the center of the board in order to play.  Tabletop simulator can't simulate this part but fear not!  An emulator has been made that allows you to play through the tabletop sim tablet.</a></p>
<p class="white">To get the emulator and learn how to set it up, visit: <br /><br /><a href="http://mee.pe/ovemu">http://mee.pe/ovemu</a></p>
<p class="white">Once you're running the OVEMU application, you can start interacting directly with the game buttons on the tablet screen.</p>
<p class="white">Enjoy the game!  And don't let the virus terminate you!</p>
<p class="white">You human scum!</p>
